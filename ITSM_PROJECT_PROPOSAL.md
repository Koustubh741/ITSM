# ITSM Platform Proposal: Key Capabilities

## 1. Platform Foundation

- **Role-Based Security:** 6 distinct roles (System Admin, IT, Inventory, Finance, Manager, Employee) ensure secure, segmented access.
- **User Management:** Self-registration workflow with admin verification and account activation.
- **Modern Workflows:** Automated state transitions for assets, tickets, and requests.

## 2. Asset Command Center

- **Real-Time Inventory:** Live "In-Stock" tracking with location and checking status.
- **Active Assignment Log:** Historical tracking of every user who has held an asset.
- **Automated Lifecycle:** Assets move automatically from "Stock" to "Assigned" to "Repair" based on actions.
- **Smart Search:** Instant lookup of assets by user, serial number, or type.

## 3. Intelligent Procurement

- **5-Stage Approval Pipeline:** Structured flow (Employee -> Manager -> IT -> Finance -> Delivery).
- **Budget & Finance Control:** Dedicated approval step for financial oversight before ordering.
- **Vendor Delivery & QC:** "Goods Received" workflow to verify assets before they enter inventory.

## 4. IT Support & Helpdesk

- **Structured Ticketing:** Issues linked directly to specific assets for faster context.
- **Mandatory Diagnostics:** Technicians must complete checklists (e.g., "Run Virus Scan") to close tickets.
- **BYOD Governance:** Registration and security clearance workflow for personal devices.

## 5. Secure Offboarding (Exit Management)

- **Snapshot Technology:** Instantly freezes a list of all assets held by a user at the moment of exit.
- **Reclamation Dashboard:** Dedicated view for Inventory Managers to process physical returns.
- **Account Locking:** Automated deactivation of user access upon workflow completion.

## 6. Employee Self-Service

- **"My Assets" Portal:** Employees see a live list of their assigned equipment.
- **Request Catalog:** Simple, Amazon-like experience for requesting new tools.
- **Transparent Tracking:** Live status updates on all tickets and requests.

## 7. Strategic Analytics

- **Executive Dashboards:** Real-time visibility into Total Asset Value and Active vs. Idle stock.
- **Operational Reports:** Tracking of Pending Requests, Ticket Volume, and Exit statuses.
- **Export Capability:** One-click CSV export for external auditing.
